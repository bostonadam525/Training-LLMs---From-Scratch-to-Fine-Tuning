# torchtune experiments

## What is torchtune?
* This is an amazing library built on top of PyTorch, designed specifically for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
* Torchtune streamlines the fine tuning process, allowing users to easily configure, run, and experiment with LLMs.
* The core philosophy behind Torchtune revolves around 4 pillars:

1. **Simplicity and Extensibility** â€” designed to be native to PyTorch, ensuring ease of use and reusability.

2. **Correctness** -- accuracy and reliability maintained through rigorous testing of every component.

3. **Stability** -- Torchtune ensures consistent and reliable functionality just as PyTorch does. 

4. **Democratization of Fine-Tuning** -- allows effective fine-tuning across various hardware configurations, making advanced model optimization accessible to users with variying computational resources.
